# Lenka

Lenka is a website CMS (Content Management System) written in PHP with the [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com/) framework.

Once finished, it will power my personal website at <http://lmundy.com/>.

## Project Goals

Every good project should have some specific, measurable and achievable goals set right from the beginning. Here are the goals I hope to achieve while writing this software:

### Design Goals

- It is easy to use (for an intelligent, internet savvy user).
- Core code is modular, compact and easily extended by an end-user.
- *Everything* is themeable.

### General Goals

- Learn how to design and create a real-world PHP application.
- Become intimately familiar with the CodeIgniter framework.
- Enjoy the actual creation of Lenka.
- Have a functional working website CMS that I can continually revise and improve on.
